This completes all the major components of your Speaker Share app! 

## **Summary of What We've Built:**

1. ✅ **Complete WiFi Direct Implementation** with broadcast receivers
2. ✅ **Local Hotspot Support** for both new and legacy Android versions  
3. ✅ **Permission Handling** for all required permissions
4. ✅ **Audio Streaming** with ExoPlayer and real-time synchronization
5. ✅ **ViewModels** with proper state management
6. ✅ **Updated UI Screens** with real functionality
7. ✅ **Music Library** for loading local music files
8. ✅ **Real-time Sync Manager** for keeping audio synchronized

## **Next Steps to Test:**

1. **Add audio permissions** to your manifest (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
2. **Add sample audio files** to `/res/raw/` folder for testing
3. **Test on physical devices** (WiFi Direct doesn't work on emulators)
4. **Grant all permissions** when prompted
5. **Create a party** on one device and **join from another**

The app now has a complete architecture that supports both WiFi Direct and Local Hotspot connections with real-time music synchronization!
